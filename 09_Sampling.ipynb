    "### What is this?\n",
    "Sampling means picking a small part of the data to represent the whole big group. Instead of looking at 100,000 rows, we might only look at 1,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use it?\n",
    "1. **Save Time**: Big data is very slow for computers to process.\n",
    "2. **Save Money**: Working with a small sample is cheaper.\n",
    "3. **Prototypes**: You can build your model quickly with a sample first.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sampling Methods:\n",
    "1. **SRS (Simple Random Sampling)**:\n",
    "   * **SRSWOR**: Without replacement. Each row is picked only once.\n",
    "   * **SRSWR**: With replacement. A row can be picked many times.\n",
    "2. **Stratified Sampling**: Divide data into groups (like Age or Region) first, then sample. This is best for \"Skewed\" data."
