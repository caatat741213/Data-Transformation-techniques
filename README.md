# Data Transformation Techniques

This project is for my **Machine Learning Programming** class. 
The goal is to practice 10 different ways to change and reduce data for machine learning.

## 10 Techniques Included:
1. **Min-Max Normalization**: Scales data between 0 and 1.
2. **Z-Score Normalization**: Centers data around 0 with a spread of 1.
3. **Distribution Fitting (Box-Cox)**: Fixes skewed data into a normal shape.
4. **Encoding**: Changes category words into numbers.
5. **Discretization**: Puts numbers into groups (bins).
6. **Clustering Concepts**: Finds similar data points.
7. **Clustering Visuals**: Shows the "Dendrogram" tree picture.
8. **Concept Hierarchies**: Rolls up small details (City) into big groups (Region).
9. **Data Reduction by Sampling**: Picks a small, fair group of data.
10. **Data Reduction by Aggregation**: Summarizes detailed data (Minutes to Hours).

## How to use:
1. Run `data_generator.py` to create the practice data.
2. Open the `.ipynb` files in VS Code.
3. Select the `venv` kernel to run the code.

## Tools used:
* Python (Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, Scipy)
* Jupyter Notebook
